# Minecraft Reflection Library

This is a work-in-progress Minecraft Reflection
plugin/library that aids in making reflection calls to 
Minecraft 1.17 and above (with backwards compatible).

This plugin downloads the mappings from Mojang and Spigot and
builds a combined list of class and method/field mappings.
